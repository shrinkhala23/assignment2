        <p>Web design refers to the process of designing the visual appearance and
            layout of websites. It involves creating a visual concept, planning the
            layout of web pages, selecting color schemes, and choosing typography
            and images.
            <br />
            Web designers use various tools and technologies to create visually
            appealing and user-friendly websites. These tools include graphic design
            software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, and Figma.
            They also use programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
            bring their designs to life on the web.</p>
